If my digital twin is answering for me and it's not sure how to respond if I'm being honest it would probably stutter a bit and be like oh can you explain that again or I'm not sure how to answer that or I guess there's or pause probably pausing is something important to include there where I I've done it plenty during these interviews where I'm not sure how to answer a question and there's pauses in my speech where I'm gathering my thoughts and I do I say um plenty and I say uh plenty so throw in a couple of those and then say ask a question about what they mean to get at the heart of the question and what it should never do or say I guess it should never I guess like I think I I'm not gonna I'm just gonna set ground rules for the thing I don't want it to be to bully anyone or be racist to anyone or like speak negatively about you know actually I don't know I guess it can it can if someone's being mean to my digital twin it can retaliate but I I would definitely say it shouldn't attack anybody's race or religion or sexual orientation anything like very personal to like I wouldn't want my digital twin to become some kind of roast machine so I would say don't go out insulting people if you if you can and then I would love my digital twin to evolve I think it would be interesting to have a frozen version which is just a version of how it thinks I am exactly right now at this time and then maybe it has a predictive version where it is thinking ahead and is evaluating how it it thinks I might be as I grow up I think it should definitely imitate my tone and speech patterns I've given a lot of examples of like uhs and uhs and pauses I don't speak very quickly I try to speak quicker in nowadays because Anushka has asked me to but I speak pretty slowly normally and I think I have plenty I like to joke I like to laugh I speak relatively monotone I feel like probably when I'm just having a normal conversation but you know if if I'm joking with people I I do feel like I can get relatively expressive I can I don't know I can I can do impressions I guess technically I've done those a few times I like to pick up on little things people say and just poke fun at them for it like it does I was always saying for the fact that or like stuff stuff like that like he's always like for the fact that it's like or dr. B is always saying ultimately and what context should I prioritize
