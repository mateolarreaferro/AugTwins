this next section is about daily routines and lifestyle and I a typical weekday will look very different depending on if I'm in class or not yeah start again oh okay yes a typical weekday depends it looks very different depending on where I'm at if I'm if I have class I like to wake up relatively early like 10 11 and I it depends on what my classes as well I guess I don't really like waking up later than 11 because then I feel like I've done nothing with my day and I can't achieve nothing with my day but recently I've gotten into a very good routine where I wake up around like 8 to 9 to and I'm able to run in the morning and then get back make breakfast eat breakfast do a little bit of work go to a cafe and have lunch somewhere and get back home do a bit more work and then make dinner eat dinner have some kind of social get together with my friends and then go to bed and currently I'm on I'm on kind of summer break so that's why my lifestyle is as enjoyable as it is and I currently also am NOT giving the work that I have given myself for this break enough attention and that's why my lifestyle is as enjoyable as it is I think I'm gonna have to make a little bit of compromise moving forward but that's alright and getting back to a school day that varies a lot depending on where in the semester I am because at the start of the semester I like to try to set myself a really nice schedule where I'm leaving time to exercise and I'm waking up at a decent hour and I'm making it to class with a comfortable time and I'm having dinner at a decent hour and I'm you know making sure I can make it to the dining hall before it closes and I'm in bed in time to get eight hours but at towards the end of the quarter I will I mean depending on my workload but most recently it's been pretty consistently that I compromise everything for my workload and that I basically do I stay up I'll stay up until about like three maybe to working and then I'll go to sleep for a few hours and then wake up either I'll wake up midday and then stay up until three again or I'll wake up at six work a bunch until I'm tired at two and then I'll take a three-hour nap and then I'll wake up and work again till three so it's either I get all my sleep at once or I get it in two separate kind of bursts anyway my sleep schedule gets very terrible and I compromise a lot of my work I compromise a lot of my life for schoolwork currently my morning ritual is to go for a run but it varies a lot I like to meditate in the mornings I like to pray in the mornings but my consistency with that is and running and any routine really is relatively inconsistent depending on if I'm in class what my workload is etc evening rituals for a while Anushka and I like to fall asleep to shows and TV and that was kind of a comforting thing to watch something and then fall asleep and not really care when it what we're watching and have some kind of white noise and I would say I'm a procrastinator in general I don't I like to have I like I have an unhealthy work work relationship I guess where I'm basically where I I procrastinate a lot and I let the tasks stress me out instead of working on it and the fact that I don't work on it stresses me out and the fact that it's stressing me out makes me less likely to work on it and it's a feedback loop that makes me end up doing everything very last-minute and it compromises the quality of my work and also my general health and I would like to change that are I am be whether or not I'm active depends on whether or not I have a lot of work and whether or not I'm in school so right now I'm very active because I'm not in school but when my school starts I'll be active for the first half of my semester and then for the next I'll be too busy and I will become very sedentary I would love to change that I have not a ton I don't have any dietary restrictions I'm not like gluten-free or veg or anything I like to eat meat I love yogurt I like dairy products going vegan would cause a lot of issues for my diet I think because like my mom is German and she's brought me up eating a ton of dairy and a ton of meat and that's just how our culture eats and that's just how we like I've always eaten and I think there's a chance that I go pescatarian but there's definitely no chance that I go fully vegan or veg maybe I could do for a little while but I don't know if I could commit to something like that I prefer to get eight hours of sleep but I'm starting to learn how to function on less sleep college has made me good on functioning with less sleep even high school I was decent at doing that but that is just not a very sustainable way to go about it I like getting eight hours of sleep and I don't have a ton of health problems which I thank God for I had asthma growing up and I almost died a lot but I don't remember a whole lot of that besides like a few incidents and getting going and writing an ambulance you know it like and stuff like that I don't remember a whole lot of that I had Lyme's disease but got over it and I have greened out a few times which is not really a health problem but is just kind of a it's overdoing it an issue with overdoing it I've yeah I don't know I don't have a ton of health problems which I'm really grateful for
