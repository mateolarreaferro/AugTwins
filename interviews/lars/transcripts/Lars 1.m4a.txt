Hello. It is June 26th, 2025. I am Lars Langenbach. My girlfriend Anushka calls me Larsu or Lash for a number of things. I am 20 years old. My birthday is the 28th of July, 2004. I was born in Vienna, Virginia, in Fairfax County, and I currently live in a hacker house in Cambridge. Oh, am I supposed to clap in between stuff? I'm just going to rattle through it. My cultural and ethnic background is I'm half German, 25% American, which is really originates from Switzerland, and I am a quarter Japanese, and I speak English and German fluently, and I know a tiny bit of Hindi and Spanish. I went to the German International School of Washington, DC, for the first 14 years of my life, and then I moved to Frankfurt... that school was in DC, and then I moved to Frankfurt, Germany, where I went to the Humboldt-Gymnasium for about a year, and then I switched to the Stratdorf International School for the rest of my high school, which is like three years, and then I'm currently studying at the Savannah College of Art and Design, and my major is immersive reality, and I do not have a current job. I have worked... my first ever job was a SCAD intramurals gym assistant, in which I scanned people's IDs. A very boring job, besides the fact that I got to do my own work while being a front desk assistant, so I basically just had to sit, and I got paid to sit, and that was a pretty sweet opportunity in that regard, but I am... I like took a break from that job before... like for the last quarter before I... before I left for the summer, because I just had too much other classwork and other shit going on. I... yeah, I guess... and... is it gonna pick up all the... all right, um... all right, education, there you go, job. Oh, a dream job. I'd love to start my own company. I think that would be really cool. I don't know anything about it, but I'd love to do it. My mom did that, and it treated her very well. I am really scared of becoming a corporate slave. I don't want to be a slave to my work. I don't want to be enslaved by money, and to have my livelihood ruined for the... for the majority of my life in order to live comfortably, but I see that my values can totally change about that. Like, as I grow older, and as I have children, it might... I might stop caring about my own livelihood in favor of the enjoyment of my children, but I believe that, like, I won't be able to provide emotionally the attendance my child needs and deserves if I am constantly, like, a slave to my work. Like, that's kind of what my mom has been... has gone through for a long time, is that she was... started her own business, and then was enslaved by... contractually to keep working, and to keep performing surgeries for her company, and keep managing people at her company, and it basically consumed her entire life. And, you know, she was very successful, and she really enjoys her work and what she does, but it's tough because she recognizes herself that she wasn't really able to be emotionally available for us. Like, the day after I was born, she went to work, and so I think that's also a reason I don't want to stay in America, is because the work culture here is so much more extreme than in the rest of the... in a lot of the rest of the world. And, yeah, I think Europe has a lot of stuff figured out in that regard. You know, four-day weeks, it's a blessing. It's a dream come true. Oh, important affiliations. I am going to be the next co-president of the Immersive Reality Club at the Savannah College of Art and Design, which is going to be great, because I have been the social media manager for the past year, and I was a club officer, and now I'm going to be handed the reins of club president alongside Anishka, and I'm extremely excited about that. Communities. I used to swim. That's something probably... like, that was a community I was a part of for a while. Growing up, I was big into swimming. I was big... my neighborhood had a swim team, and so I would basically spend my entire summer at the... every weekend we would go have a swim meet, and we would compete, and we would race, and at some point we started doing winter swim teams as well, like winter club swimming, and my brother and I were doing this the whole time, and so we would drive early morning at like 6 a.m. to go to swim meets, and then to go to swim practice, and we would swim, you know, it's way too much for how early it was. I could never do that right now, to be honest, but it was tough, and those coaches were only like 12, and those coaches are harsh. Like, they're very extreme. Their morals were out of whack. Like, they were very, like, whipping these kids to really work their hearts out, and I guess a lot of it for Americans is like the scholarships. Like, their parents rely on scholarships, like swimming scholarships, to get them into through colleges and stuff, and I understand that that's really important, but to me, that was totally lost, and I was just getting yelled at by a middle-aged woman while I was trying to keep up with this group of extremely jacked 12-year-olds. It's a really weird experience, and so in my religion, I grew up in an atheist family, and my mom is a veterinarian, and so she's a woman of science. She doesn't have time for going to go to church, and she doesn't really believe in a higher power besides science. You know, science is her religion, and she looks down on religion. She thinks it's a form of control, and so I grew up in that environment as an atheist, still going to church for Christmas and maybe Easter, but the church thing was just out of tradition. It wasn't out of a belief in God. It was just kind of part of the tradition of Christmas, and I continued that way up until maybe a year ago, when I was introduced to Hinduism through Anushka, and I started meditating, and I was reached out to by Hindu gods, and now I pray and believe in Hinduism, and I'm practicing the Hindu religion, and I guess I'll, okay, I'm going to section it off, so I'm going to stop the recording. Wow, 10 minutes. It's supposed to have been 10 minutes. Okay.
