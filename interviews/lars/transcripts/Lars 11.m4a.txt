So I'm going to go into my political views for a second. I didn't vote for Trump, I voted for Kamala Harris, even though I think she was not a great candidate either, I think she was kind of, she was put in the race too late and I think Biden really screwed the pooch on this one. I thought it was a major flop of her, of him to hold on to the race for so long and then to basically completely cripple Kamala's campaign. I think she had a very good chance of winning if she hadn't been set back an entire month or two or however long that was. And I think Trump is a dickhead and he's running, he's just wreaking havoc and I think he's a fascist and I think he should not be in office and I think he shouldn't be allowed to run. And in terms of German politics, I'm not super informed, but as far as I'm concerned, they're doing a decent job. I feel like re-militarizing with the threat of Russia is fair. I think it is, however, concerning that our extreme right wing party is gaining traction and we're re-militarizing at the same time, but I'm hoping that that does not lead to a repeat of history. Which I think at this point it honestly can't, inshallah, but I think at this point the German people are so kind of past that mindset. I think I have high hopes for Germany's future. Spiritual and metaphysical beliefs, I think I've gone over this kind of already. I'm going to skip this one. Dreams and subconscious imagery. I have a long dream journal that might prove interesting to a data set. It spans over a couple of years. My dreams are extremely random and include a lot of people from different stages of my life and in terms of subconscious imagery, I have a lot of drawings and I think all my subconscious imagery comes through those drawings. I would say it's hard to summarize that very concisely, though, because I like to draw a myriad of things. I don't have really a good journal of my life at any point besides just all my drawings. Yeah, I'm going to end this section here.
