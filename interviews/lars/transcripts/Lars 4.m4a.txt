Okay, my main hobbies and creative outlets are drawing. I've always liked to draw since I was a kid. It's been one of my favorite things to do in life is draw. I also like to make music that I haven't done since a kid. I've just started doing that in high school with my best friend Ulyss. We basically did it as a joke for a long time where we would just make dumb songs to send each other back and forth and then eventually we found it to be an actually great creative outlet for us both and we love to still love to write songs and make music and send each other random tracks we're working on and exploring sound. I also I like to paint. I don't do it often anymore but in high school that was a huge creative outlet for me. I did an entire kind of exhibition from start to finish all like comprising of like maybe seven paintings or eight paintings or so and it was that was a extremely important creative outlet for me at the time and my favorite I actually immersive media is also a creative outlet for me. I got into immersive game development through Anushka. She introduced me to the immersive reality club and the entire major as a concept at the Savannah College of Art and Design and for me that was an is now a huge creative technology overarchingly is a huge creative outlet for me right now and that I'm able to create stuff that kind of transcends 2D picture and you know and sound even and to create entire experiences and exhibitions. It's kind of a much broader and a much more challenging creative space for me to work in and is freeing and limiting in different ways than my other creative outlets are. I like to run which is a hobby of mine. I think it's important like personal health is important. I also like to cook. Cooking is fun. I'm not great at it but I enjoy it and I am sufficient and I don't like to read. I love to watch movies. I love paintings. I like going to museums. I like seeing historical artifacts and historical art and I like listening to music in the car and my headphones while I'm working out, while I'm waiting for the bus, while I'm sitting on the train, while I'm going anywhere or I don't or doing anything really. I love listening to music. I don't like to listen to music with lyrics while I'm working and generally music sometimes is too much for me when I'm working. I find it hard to concentrate with music happening when I'm working on something that includes writing or coding or anything that requires a lot of you know high intensity like brain power. Creative processes I find like like drawing or painting I find extremely easy when I'm listening to music and I think it often inspires a lot of what I'm working on. Sometimes I'll just listen to a song and then just start drawing what that song feels like to me. I yeah I love watching movies. I love sci-fi was kind of my first favorite genre I guess growing up with Star Wars. I definitely started getting into like you know adventure films were also huge like Indiana Jones and you know the Pirates of the Caribbean all that kind of these massive universes of kind of fantasy and and sci-fi were always really appealing and then I guess recently I started getting more into like horror and drama and you know getting scared became fun at some point where it was very interesting and entertaining to be on the edge of your seat for the entire like being on the edge of your seat like being scared was kind of fun at some point and then what kind of and stories and aesthetics that resonate a lot with me. I was talking about this recently but surrealism is something that has always resonated with me as an aesthetic particularly because of my kind of personal goal of like self-expression. I found this drawing and depicting in general your subconscious and the things that you might not be actively thinking about I found that extremely interesting and it's an aesthetic that I'm very frequently drawn to. I love because I grew up loving fantasy and sci-fi kind of this idea of creating your own universe and your own worlds and painting is always really valuable to me. I also you know I love expressionism. I don't love like modern digital art like like there's like how maybe like hyper realism is something that I never got very into. I like comic books I guess is also like an aesthetic kind of that I was very drawn to. I was never super into anime but I liked Tintin and I guess like some of the aesthetics I guess Speed Racer that was also that's technically an anime aesthetic though so I do like the aesthetic of some animes sure but I Anyway those are some aesthetics that resonate with me. I'm currently obsessed with the Beatles. I'm always obsessed with the Beatles. I don't know if I'll ever not be obsessed with the Beatles but I love watching documentaries and One of my favorite podcasts, probably my favorite podcast was the Paul McCartney podcast where he talked about the meaning behind all of his lyrics of every basically every song he ever wrote and that was a great podcast. I loved it. It was a great podcast. It was a really fun podcast. It was a really about the meaning behind all of his lyrics of every basically every song he ever wrote and so to me that was just the best thing ever because he was talking about the backstory behind all my favorite songs. For a while I was also obsessed with Pink Floyd and the story of Sid Barrett and kind of the story of each album. I love like hearing about how albums were made. I love hearing about music and musicians and their stories and I think like a lot of my interests are just kind of art related and and I like learning about the creative process in general I guess and I like learning how to improve my creative process. An example I'll give is I heard about David Bowie taking his dream journal and then cutting up the pages and cutting out individual words and then laying these words out and arranging them into a song and I thought that was like an amazing way to write a song and to make a piece of poetry was just taking unrelated words and mashing them together. I've tried that before and I wrote a song that I thought was pretty interesting and yeah I'd say generally my interest and passion a lot of it is in creative outlets and then also I think I'm really passionate about kind of social dynamics and just like my friends and having fun. I like parties and I like hanging out with my friends and just having long conversations even if it's about nothing it's just fun.
