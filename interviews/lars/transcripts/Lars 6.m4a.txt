So, the apps I use most often on my phone are WhatsApp, just to send messages, and photos to look at my photo library, and the camera app to take photos of stuff, the music app to listen to music, and I watch a lot of YouTube about, you know, synthesizers and movies and music stuff, and I've been forced to start using Signal, which is just like a worse version of WhatsApp, so I use that a little bit now, and I use Safari to look things up on my phone, not Chrome, but on my computer I use Chrome only, and I have a Windows machine, so Safari doesn't exist on there anyway. I use Outlook to send emails, I don't know if this is valuable data, and I use Unreal Engine and TouchDesigner for my work, and I think AI is limited in its use, but it's so new that it can be applied in so many interesting ways. It's new and it's not, like it's kind of old, but it's kind of coming onto the market in a way that's very new, and so it's being applied everywhere by everybody, and I think it's extremely unnecessary to be applied in most cases, but in some areas I think it is definitely able to make a huge difference, and it's very useful, and it's going to speed up a lot of stuff, and it's going to make a lot of stuff exponentially grow, because it will automate so much, and I think that's great, and I think people who talk badly on AI or try to boycott AI are just going to get left behind, and I think it's stupid to boycott AI. I think it's part of the future, whether you want it to be or not, and you just have to kind of get with it or get left behind. I think my main issue with AI is digital privacy, in which really open AI is getting data from everywhere completely illegally, and is just getting away with it, and it's scraping every little nook and cranny of the internet for all of its data, and I just think that's obviously unethical, because nobody has given it the permission to do that, so that's shitty, but it's a great tool, and it's extremely easy to use. My phone is always going to be Apple, probably. I don't think I'll ever have the balls to switch to Google or Android, to be honest, but my computer, I like having a Windows computer, I like working on Windows computers. I enjoy owning a MacBook, but my MacBook is extremely old, it's from like 2016, so it's very limited use, and I try to be a lighter tech user than I am. I think I'm on my phone a lot. I have like probably, actually this might be interesting for everyone to say, how much screen time they have. I have like probably four and a half hours, let's see, wow, three hours and 40 minutes, but it's down 13% from last week, which I'm sure was, yeah, four hours. Four hours is probably like my average, and that's not counting how much time I spend on my laptop, and I think my iPad is actually counted into that time, but I also spend time on there. So that's my technology use.
