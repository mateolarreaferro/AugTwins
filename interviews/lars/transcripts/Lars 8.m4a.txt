My favorite books are... I don't read a lot. I like A Fear in Loathing in Las Vegas a lot. That's the most recent book I think I've read. I really liked Mrs. Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. Growing up I thought that was a fun book. One of my favorite children's books is Where the Wild Things Are, which is just like a really sweet fun book. But movies, I watch a lot of movies and I really like movies. I really like the movie Trainspotting a lot because it's kind of about my least favorite thing in life and like my biggest fear. I like Everything, Everywhere, All at Once. I thought that was a great film. I love Star Wars. I kind of have gone over a lot of movie stuff previously. I like dramas. I'm not super into romantic comedies or anything like that. I don't think I've been exposed to a lot of them. I like funny movies and like I didn't really know what genre The Big Lebowski is, but like this kind of... I like Wes Anderson a lot. Like he has fun movies. Those are an interesting, always a good watch. I like Minecraft. It's one of my favorite games of all time. I really was into Sea of Thieves for a long time with my middle school friends. And my brother and I played Rainbow Six Siege a lot. He's into like war games like Insurgency, Sandstorm, and this kind of stuff. And so I play a lot of that with him. We play Helldivers a lot which is like sci-fi games, fun game. And I was never into console. I was mainly on my PC. Growing up even like these original like DS Nintendo games were super influential like Plants vs. Zombies and Bomberman and all this stuff. I like Breaking Bad. I like Better Call Saul. I like... I even watched like that Prison Break. That kind of show about escaping a bunch of prisons and stuff. That was a fun show. I loved Gravity Falls growing up and Phineas and Ferb and Scooby-Doo. And I like mystery. I like kind of this puzzle solving. Some of my favorite artists. I think I've gone over a lot of this already. I like classic rock. I like a lot of rap music. But classic rock will always kind of be my favorite genre. It'll always be like my comfort genre. The Beatles and Queen and the Rolling Stones and David Bowie and like all these kind of like classic rock icons will always be my favorite, you know, kind of musical genre. And then I like these songs or quotes. You know some of some of the songs I feel like that resonated a lot with me for a long time. Child of Vision by Supertramp was one of my favorite songs and it was one that I felt like really was kind of describing me. But I didn't know why until like now I read the lyrics and it sounds like just kind of an idiot kid that was getting in a bunch of dumb shit and needed to correct his ways. And there's this quote from the song Helplessness Blues by the Fleet Foxes where he says something like I gotta remember the quote. It was, and if I know only one thing it's that everything I see of the world around me is so inconceivable often I barely can speak. And I find that line very relatable lately. Just because I feel like I socially am relatively quiet in most, in like a lot of social situations when I'm not super comfortable on people I'm just very quiet. And I often find myself just kind of observing the world and just sometimes feel like I'm just here to watch everything unfold. And I don't really feel like sometimes I even like have to add anything to it or feel the need to, I don't know, I mean I feel the need to contribute to society or whatever but I don't feel like I have much to add in terms of, like sometimes I just feel like I'm an observer of what's going on around me. And mythologies that really resonate with me would be I guess a lot of, this is not really mythology, but a lot of like conspiracy theory kind of stuff I think is really funny and really entertaining. And I think there's a lot of like silly kind of allure to all of this lore behind UFOs and Bigfoot and all this stuff. I find it very entertaining and that's why shows like Gravity Falls were so fun to watch was because they were exploring this kind of silly playful stuff. More seriously Hindu mythology I find extremely beautiful and I feel very drawn to these stories and I find them like just beautiful metaphors to make something out of life. And if there's any symbols or metaphors I return to often, I guess in in high school for a while there I was kind of on
