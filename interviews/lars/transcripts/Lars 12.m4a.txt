I'm gonna go over some of the I guess kind of quote-unquote chapters of my life and I'm gonna title each chapter and I'm gonna kind of explain how long these chapters were and how I guess exactly how I remember each chapter of my life and then I'm gonna go briefly into the future talking about what I see happening and then I'm gonna I'm gonna cut it there so basically I would say the first chapter of my life was just my childhood I I guess abstractly would call it just the woods where I was growing up basically in in Vienna Virginia and I was mainly I call it the woods because at this time I was living in a house this was from the ages of 1 to 14 I would I could break this into a bunch of different sub chapters but I would rather categorize this entire 14 years of my life really as one continued chapter where I was living in this the same house it was 10228 Tamarack Drive and I and because I was living there for these 14 years that's why I kind of clump this in my memory I think yeah we'll get to we'll get to some stuff here really at this time this house is located by the woods and so we were my brother and I growing up would go out into the woods to play and to entertain ourselves and so we'd run around the along the creek we'd throw big rocks in the water we'd you know use sticks as swords and we would knock down weeds and we'd bring our pocket knives and we'd we'd cut little little twigs and we'd we'd sharpen twigs and make them spears and it was just kind of like a boys will be boys you know like we were just growing up together I was really say like the first 10 years of my life this was extremely prominent you know theme was these woods that I live next to and school to me was really just a place that I was and I didn't understand why I was there people told me to learn but I really don't feel like I was great at school for most of my schooling I was just kind of there and I was my head was always in the clouds and my favorite thing was to get home and to go in the woods or to play video games those are like really my two favorite things to do or play with my toys you know I had we had my brother and I had an entire Lego a room dedicated to our Legos so we would basically just dump out all of our Legos and and we'd play with them every every day for so many days and so many hours and that was really what was important to us it was the woods Legos and Minecraft and so for us that was all we did and we would hang out with the boys in the neighborhood and we would meet up and kind of be rowdy and annoy each other and all this kind of stuff and so that first those first ten years were very simple in that way where it was just my brother and I just kind of kicking it in the woods causing a ruckus yeah playing video games watching movies that was our favorite thing school was yeah again just kind of I was there and I was bored all the time but I think I would attribute school to a lot of my creativity now was because I spent so much time bored I had so much time to kind of let my mind wander and come up with all the stuff they do and I drew so much in school because I was so bored and this is yeah growing up like this is kind of where a lot of my creative habits came from was because since I was able to pick up a pen like I've just always been drawing and I always throughout all my schooling was drawing I would say you know from 10 to 14 you know my sister became a big part of my life we would play a lot and we would we would have a lot of fun together we would just annoy each other and like it was very fun like this is also when my brother is entering middle school and high school and stuff so he's you know he has you know high school to deal with and whatever so my sister came into my life at that point so we could kind of you know keep each other entertained and you know horse around and I also at that point was entering middle school and so my friend group there became super important to me that's where I'm you know I started getting really close to Lucas my my childhood best friend and so that was yeah the first 14 years of my life really was that and then I moved to Germany and that was really why I would lump up those first 14 years at its own chapter and then moving to Germany was its own experience those four years I feel like was a whole new lifetime for me really where moving to Germany I was extremely depressed and I was just doing really terribly mentally because I had basically left all my friends behind that my childhood house behind everything that I knew I would I just kind of dropped and was setting up a new life in Germany and this is when I was introduced to weed so when I was introduced to drugs and like I guess being a real teenager and getting into dumb situations it was in Germany like I was I was really depressed because of the move and then I was just kind of lost and I didn't care particularly for a lot of Germany I didn't I it was a depressing country for a lot of the year it's very cold and it's very dark and yeah so I got into plenty of tomfoolery I think for the next I'd say I'd lump you know the next four years into its own category and that's just like I'll just call it cloud I'll title this chapter cloud or I don't know and then yeah that was and then all through high school I started dating and that became like its own new thing I had one girlfriend I really cared for and then she left to Japan and I was totally devastated and then I dated around a bit and then I just kind of gave up on all that shit and I just focused on art which was basically in my last two years of high school I had time to put together an exhibition for my that was kind of my final for my art class and art was one of my higher level classes so that was really the most important thing to me for the last two years of high school it was just getting this exhibition together and then when that was done I it was time for colleges so I applied to a bunch of colleges and I got into the college of art and design and the next chapter I'd say up until now is just been kind of a ton of personal growth I got to college and was a total idiot and was just very I don't know I just I feel like I didn't know what to do with myself and I had no self-control so I was just this kind of maniac freshman until I I met Anushka and then I I fell in love with Anushka and I think I was I really she gave me kind of an anchor kind of like a rock in my life where I had something that I really valued and I had a really good relationship with her that I knew that I couldn't lose and I think that was a valuable thing for me especially at the time where I was just kind of yeah again just kind of lost and that helped me a lot through it helped me through a lot of personal growth and going from a teenager to not was and I guess an important moment like just growing up to do less stupid shit is was a lot of what college was about and then there was a lot of focusing on academics and figuring out how to actually hone my skill like now I wasn't in high school anymore I couldn't I wasn't in schooling I was seeking higher education and it was time to get serious and figure out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life and that's when I stumbled into creative technology really and I fell in love with VR and generally just all the art you could make using technology and I followed that into for yeah for two years until I had a summer break where I went to the augmentation lab and then they said that they were going to make it Anushka's idea was to make a digital twin initially of herself but then she decided to make it of a couple people and so now I'm here making a voice recording to feed to an AI that will now have my basically my entire life story and it will impersonate me and I'm pretty excited about that
