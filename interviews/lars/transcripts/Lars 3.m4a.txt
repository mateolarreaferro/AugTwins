This is part three social life and relationships. My closest relationships are first with my partner Anushka. We have a really loving relationship. We are basically best friends and we spend every like basically every second of every day together and we have for the past two years and it's been the best time ever and I am really grateful to have Anushka in my life and she makes me a better person and she is very funny and we keep each other very entertained in life which I think is really important. We never let each other get bored which I think is good and we like to annoy each other and and just take care of each other and treat each other well and I think that's one of the most important if not the most important in my life right person in my life right now and my my brother Wolf is also an extremely important person in my life he's four years older than me and we've always had a really good close relationship he's looked out for me for my entire life and has always been there to help out and like really watch over and make sure that you know everything is going okay and he's just been there for me throughout my whole life and I'm also extremely grateful to have him as a part of it he's a great guy and he's also just like I guess one of my closest friends and we're we have a lot of fun together we we like to play together like we've always liked to play together like as kids and now as adults like we play video games all the time together and yeah he's he's one of my favorite people in the world and my little sister I also I have a similarly close relationship with we she's seven years younger than me but we've always gotten along really well and I I've always played a lot with her just because like she was so much younger and I I guess Wolf set a good example for me and that he was very loving to me and like we spent a lot of time together and played a lot together so I it felt only natural to do the same thing with my little sister even though she was so much younger and I think usually an age gap like seven years is a lot but for us we're still very close and we get along really well together we like watch TV a lot together like Phineas and Ferb and all this stuff growing up and I always like would drive around in the shopping cart and stuff and like drift the shopping cart with her in it and even when she's like super young in the stroller she would scream a lot because I would always drive way too fast in the stroller and like drift the stroller I was doing like wheelies with the stroller and stuff and I mean it's gonna take a while to go through all my friends and family but my mother is also like obviously one of the most important people in my life she's she's provided a ton for me and my whole family like she's really been like she's kind of a superhero in my eyes like she can do anything and is good at everything and is able to really like exceed anything I thought was humanly possible like though she puts a lot of work into raising me and she put a lot of work into her work and she's been able to have an insanely successful career while still being able to provide for like like provide emotionally for her children and and I'm also just like I've I've grown really close to her you know when I was a teenager she moved me to Germany the whole family moved to Germany and I definitely was very I guess spiteful about that for a long time and I think in the past two three years I've been able to I mean fully get over that and just have a rekindle my relationship with her and I think we're we're very close now more than more than ever my father I also have a good relationship with he's a real nerd and he likes Star Wars and he likes fantasy and sci-fi and he definitely he's a very creative person and he's always liked design and always liked art and he's really supported me in my love for the same and he's always made my brother and I very always encouraged us to be very creative and he you know he's so happy that we love Star Wars and we love David Bowie and we love the same things that he does because you know and we're happy to be the same because it's awesome stuff he's introduced us to so much great stuff so many great movies so much culture so much just yeah great culture that he's exposed me to and I think yeah yeah my yeah I don't know if I could yeah he's a great guy I have a bunch of friends a bunch of friends through my life I feel like I've been very fortunate to have made good friends wherever I go Lucas Witzka is one of my best friends he we met in kindergarten and we've had a really strong relationship throughout our entire lives and we're really grateful to have each other for basically our whole lives and have known each other for so long and we support each other and everything we do and he's also a creative person so we have always bonded over our creativity and our love for music and drawing and and supported each other's creative endeavors and we still continue to my my friend Ulyss is was has been my one of my best friends as well throughout all of high school we lived together for a long time and he kind of became almost like a twin brother of mine for a long time where we shared a house and we shared apartments and we lived kind of with each other and cooked with each other and you know did exercise together and you know we were basically twin brothers for all of high school and he's also a creative person and I think yeah we similarly to Lucas we've helped support each other through all of our creative endeavors and we're really best really best friends yeah I mean I have so many more friends but should I have like just this one question be its own yeah Tom Spiegel is a person a friend I met in the German public school I went to the Humboldt Gymnasium and he is also a close friend of mine still though we have a more kind of on and off friendship where we'll basically check in on each other every like half year and that is kind of our ritual where we'll meet up every half year and basically feel each other in on what's happened in our lives and it's always like kind of picking up where we left off and I really value that relationship I have my friend Ben Hammond in SCAD he's the first person I met at SCAD and he's my best friend at SCAD and he is we have a really great relationship we've lived together basically through all of SCAD and he's we've been through a lot of growth together and we've just kind of and a lot of education we've spent together and we've motivated each other through a lot of my entire time at SCAD and I'd say those are really and Erteza is a great friend of mine who I also met at SCAD and who I'm still great friends with and I'm spending a lot of time with and really getting to know and I really like him and I really love his company he motivates me a lot creatively and professionally really to be a really take life by the handles and like get the most I can out of life he's a very motivated motivational figure to me and my friend Jacob Alexander I also met at SCAD he was definitely like a role model for me he's a year older doing the same major actually he's like four years older maybe he was kind of an older brother at SCAD for a while where he he was kind of paving his own path in a lot of ways and finding his finding a foothold in life almost he is now an ultra marathon runner and so I think that is also he's a big inspiration a big motivational figure throughout my time at SCAD and my friend Tapish is also a friend I share with Anushka and Erteza and he's a great hilarious character and he's a very polarizing figure because he's betrayed our trust in in a certain way he drugged us at some point and so there was there was a definitely a time in our friendship where you know that that definitely weighed on our the way I saw him but he is a great guy and he's a funny guy and you know he he's just a character and he's someone that I think is really important because he's so funny like he's just a funny guy Shreya is a great friend I made and at SCAD and she's really funny and she's like one of the most positive people I've ever met in life and she's really awesome like she's just so happy and so like like really just wants to be happy like that's she just wants she's a very positive influence on everything and no I don't think so I think it's just I think there was a question about handling conflict yeah I'll move on how do I handle conflict I I used to be very non confrontational but have learned that that kind of leads nowhere so I try to be more confrontational nowadays I try to just kind of bite the bullet and if something's going wrong with someone I'll just tell them so I can move on with my life and I do like to be very diplomatic I like to see other people's perspectives I like to understand where people are coming from I don't love I don't usually just hate someone but sometimes I really I understand that I'm not gonna be somebody's friend so I just will kind of say goodbye to that opportunity of being their friend and just learn to live with them if I have to I I think I'm pretty community oriented like I like to be a part of a social circle I like to contribute to a social circle like to be around people that I I really love and I've always felt like very like I do my best and I live best with a group of people that I am extremely close to and I don't like to have a bunch of people that I kind of know but I rather have like three or four that I really would die for and my love language is I guess very physical I like I like to express love with you know like by holding somebody's hand and by you know hugging some like showing affection that way I also just like to compliment people and and appreciate what I like about a person and what they add to my life and I like to yeah I think I'm pretty I'm relatively vocal about what I love about people and who I love and I oh my god there's so many pets I've had I'll sum it down to two my pet currently is Sara Ali Khan and she is a bearded dragon and she has her own history that I don't know if I'll get into right now but she's great and I love her and she's a cute little lizard and the other pet that's like really important in my life is my cat itchy who died in 2022 maybe or or something and he was just like very emotionally supportive and he's like he was like my emotional support animal for all of high school like in all of middle school it was just he like he lived in my room and would we would spend basically every day together and it was very important to my life and and I'm gonna call it at that
