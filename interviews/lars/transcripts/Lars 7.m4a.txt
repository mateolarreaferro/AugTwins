So, I make decisions by, I guess, just weighing pros and cons most of the time. I think I try not to be reactionary to things. I try to see other people's opinions and understand where people are coming from before I evaluate them, but I have my biases. I definitely do judge people based on how they talk, how they look, how my very first impression of them does stand for a lot of how I feel about someone before I actually get to know them. And generally, if I'm making an important decision, a lot of what I'm doing is trusting my gut to an extent, but also trying to rationalize everything and make sure that logically I'm making the right decision. I'm thinking if I were to choose which university I was going to or whatever, I would weigh pros and cons of each and just try to figure out what the best move is. And I definitely talk to myself in my head, but I noticed this recently that the voice that is in my head usually, or very often, is the voice of somebody else, like I'm kind of impersonating other people when I talk to myself, or thinking how other people would say things, or what I would say to a different person if they were with me at the time. A lot of my inner dialogue is really me thinking about, if I was talking to this person, how would I explain this to them? That's a lot of it, but then obviously I do have my own kind of self-dialogue where I'm just kind of narrating the stuff that's happening, or random subconscious stuff that gets brought up and passes, and then gets brought up and passes. That voice is usually pretty relaxed, I guess. I definitely think I have anxiety, which the voice can get pretty worked up about stuff and pretty out of hand, I guess, in terms of just when I get stressed, I have a tendency to stress myself out, and I definitely get stuck in feedback loops of stressing myself out a lot. And when I'm anxious, yeah, I have a hard time staying in the moment. Usually when I'm anxious about something, it's about either how something just went, or something that happened in the past that I'm anxious about, or something that's in the future that I'm anxious about. If I'm about to present something, I'll get anxious about presenting, and I'll get really in my head, and I'll really feel shaky and very stressed, and I feel like I show a lot of physical symptoms when I'm very anxious about something, especially a presentation. But then if something in the past, like if I just met someone, or if I just had an important conversation with someone, and I'm looking back at the conversation, then the anxiety is mainly me mulling over everything I said, and could I have said it better, what did I say that was wrong, why did this happen, why did that happen. And what I can do to calm down is just really breathe, and just kind of tell myself to relax. I just chant, I guess, a mantra to myself, and kind of remind myself that God is with me, and I'm not just some animal or whatever, like I can't give, I'm being protected, somebody's with me, it's not just me. And if I have any reoccurring thoughts, I mean, I think about the people I love a lot, and that brings me a lot of comfort. I do repeat Shiva's mantra to myself a lot, and that brings me a lot of comfort. I definitely think I'm anxious about social situations, and anxious about how I'm perceived, and I'm self-conscious about how I'm perceived at times, and I, I don't know, I guess I think about, I think about creative stuff a lot, I guess. I have song ideas all the time, and I'll compose a whole thing in my head, and then pull out my phone to record what that would sound like, and then I listen back to it, and I'm just like, this sounds kind of crazy, like I'm just doing all kinds of mouth guitar and all kinds of shit. And philosophical beliefs, I, I've touched on this before, I think I, like, I really, I care about kindness a lot, I care about my family a lot, I care about the people I love a lot, I care about kind of having, I guess a lasting impact on the world, like a positive impact on the world. I care about treating others well, and I also do, like, I believe in kind of holding people accountable for shit, and, and, you know, I guess, like if someone's being an asshole to me, like, I do definitely have part of me that is like, oh, whatever, they're just another human, they're having a bad day or whatever, but, you know, there's definitely a reactionary side of me that is like, fuck this guy, they're a fucking asshole, and I'll flip them off or whatever, or like, or I don't know, I'll just, in traffic or whatever, you know, I'll just be like, oh, fuck you, I don't know, I don't know if this, okay, and then I definitely try to think very logically, I think recently I've been trying to trust my intuition a lot more, I think emotionally, I, I feel very out of touch with my emotions, so when I am thinking emotionally, it seems like very, I guess, sudden, or very out of the blue, and I, like, I try to remain logical, and trust my gut, and I'm trying to become a more emotionally aware, have they left?
