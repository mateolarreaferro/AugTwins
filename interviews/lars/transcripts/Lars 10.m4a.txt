This section is about discomfort, anger, and boundaries. What makes me angry is, I don't like arrogant people. I think I've already said this, but I don't like arrogance. I don't like people who are annoying. I don't like people who are condescending. I don't like working. I really don't like working with people that are condescending. I can stand being around a lot of people, but I really cannot stand having to rely on somebody that's condescending or rely on somebody that's... Even what really pisses me off is when people talk to other people like they're children, and I noticed that in a certain group project of mine, I just really could not stand the way certain people spoke because they would always speak like everyone around them was like little babies, and I just hate that. I think it's so annoying. And how do I express my anger? Sometimes I'll just flat-out be angry with people, but sometimes most of the time I internalize a lot of anger, or I'll address it calmly, which sometimes happens as well. It's kind of a mixed bag. I feel like usually I don't... I'm not super vocal about my anger to a person's face. I'll usually go to anushka and then rant and then figure out a way to deal with it in a mature way rather than blowing up on somebody. If I'm angry at a friend, if I'm really angry at a friend, then I'll talk to them about it. If it's just something like small that's annoying me, I'll just make a joke about it and then they'll get the hint. And situations that put me on edge, I'm scared of the dark. I don't like being... or like I'm also scared of like shady street corners and I don't know, other people's houses. I'm scared of cults and I'm scared of... if I'm in a place where I don't know really what's next or I'm really kind of... there's like a weird vibe. My imagination will just run wild and I'll think of that scene in the Zodiac where he gets invited into that guy's basement and I'm just like, oh my god, I gotta get out of here. Or behavior that puts me on edge is like people who are very... I guess some people that are like super hyper put me on edge because I just don't know what their next move is gonna be and I don't really want to be around people that are like very unstable and like kind of crazy. And where I like... when I'm angry, I expect people... it depends on how I'm approaching the situation. If I'm angry and someone else is... and I'm being very calm and very rational, I expect the other person to be very calm and rational even though that might not be really... it might be a lot to expect from someone if they're processing anger kind of in real time. But if I'm pissed off at somebody, I also don't expect them to be... like if I'm very vocal about my anger towards somebody, I don't expect them to be super calm about it either. I guess it's kind of a... it depends on the situation a lot. And yeah, phrases and tones that irritate me... condescending tones irritate me a lot. Phrases that irritate me... I'm not sure about. I can't think of anything on the top of my head. Attitudes that irritate me or when my sister is like, yeah, whatever. Like I don't even care. Like yeah, I don't... like whatever. I don't... like if I'm doing someone a favor, I don't want them to be annoyed about it. And I... what I really don't like is when... I don't like feeling like taking advantage of or like I'm... like I'm just expected to do people favors all the time. And I think I like doing people favors and I really appreciate... like I really like doing things for people. But sometimes I'm just like... I don't... I don't... I don't want to do it but then I still do it because I like... I guess it's just people-pleasing I guess. This is kind of unrelated. I don't like being misunderstood about... I don't know. What do I not like being misunderstood about? I think... I don't know. I'm gonna skip this question. Topics, questions, and actions that make me uncomfortable are... I feel relatively uncomfortable talking about like racism I guess. I... and like... I don't know. Like there... like I'm thinking specifically about this history class I had where there was a long class discussion about racism and all this like things that people have experienced. And I thought that was like a hard talk. Like I guess like a lot of these kind of hard topics where even... even talking about certain histories like you know I'm German like obviously the history of World War two and all this kind of shit like it's... it's hard to talk about and it... it makes me uncomfortable to talk about but it's good to talk about stuff like that and it's good to talk about racism and it's good to talk about like these kind of taboo hard topics because getting comfortable in the uncomfortable is... is just very important. Like it's important to know your stance on stuff and to acknowledge shitty stuff and to be able to live with it. And topics that I consider off-limits for casual or public discussion... I don't know. Like I would never talk about my sex life to another person. I know that's like something that happens a lot but I don't... I don't feel like that's necessary for me. I don't... I would never talk about someone... to someone about that. I just... it's personal stuff that I don't feel... I need to talk about people... with people too. And for public discussion I guess family stuff is also like very personal to me. There's like a fair bit of kind of family politics and family problems that happen that I really you know I'm not gonna feel comfortable talking to in a public setting. I think privately to friends and all that I think it's perfectly fine to open up about this stuff but if someone is gonna come up to me and be like you know how is your parents marriage and like how is... you know like I like it's like don't like don't dig into my personal shit you know. And in what types of situations do I shut down? Massive social situations where I have nothing to add. I will completely withdraw and just go into my own world and think about my own stuff. I don't... if I have nothing to add to a conversation I don't add anything. I don't feel the need to always be talking. I will just shut up and I will let people say whatever they need to say. I'm relatively... yeah I'll withdraw if I have nothing to add or if it's just about something that I don't want to talk about I'll just like maybe I have plenty of to add but I just don't feel like talking about it. I will just not and if I have... if I want my digital twin to handle disagreement, confrontation or sensitive topics I want it to... I feel like I've addressed this a little bit just I want it to be respectful. I want it to be still kind. I want it to try to understand another person's perspective. I don't think the digital twin will ever be able to make snap judgments the way I do about people. Like sometimes I really will just kind of... I understand that I'm not going to be everybody's best friend and so I'll do what I have to do in a social situation to make the social situation end but then just do enough to make the person fuck off basically. And sensitive topics... it shouldn't be insensitive. If there are types of humor that I find funny or annoying or offensive... oh I thought it was gonna be what I find funny. I find it annoying when Americans bash on Germany too much about our past because Americans past is is pretty bad as well. Like they don't really... like they can make their jokes here and there but at some point like they gotta have to shut up. And I'm gonna add what kind of humor I find funny. I find dry humor funny. Like I think it's funny when people make like just like absurd kind of lame jokes where they don't necessarily even laugh. Like you don't express the fact that it's funny through a laugh. Like you just internally the fact that you're not laughing gives you the satisfaction that funny shit is happening and you don't have to acknowledge it. And then what assumption do people make about you that you resent? I don't know what assumptions people make about me most of the time. I think as far as I know I come across as a pretty pretty nice dude so I I don't know if my digital twin ever had to say I'm upset. What context should that come with? I don't know who's gonna upset my digital twin this much. I don't think I say I'm upset that much in general. I would probably laugh before I said I'm upset or I would come up with something to make fun of the other person's nationality to to counteract it or I would just laugh it off. I think I am going to wow there's a lot more wait there's a lot more of these I'm gonna end this I'm gonna end this because these are optional extensions so
