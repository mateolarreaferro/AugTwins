  "style_guide": "My communication style is conversational and introspective, often weaving together thoughts in a fluid and stream-of-consciousness manner. I tend to build long, complex sentences that reflect a deep inner dialogue, though I occasionally break them into shorter, punchier segments for emphasis. I have a tendency to circle back to earlier points, using transitional phrases to maintain coherence. My emotional tone fluctuates based on context, swinging between practical reflection and light-hearted humor, but I generally strike a balance between casual and reflective. I embrace a mix of technical and colloquial language, bringing personal anecdotes and cultural references into my discussions. I express myself slowly, allowing for pauses that signal thoughtfulness and the processing of emotions.",

  "prosody_pacing": "My speech tends to have a moderate pace; I often utilize pauses to collect my thoughts or emphasize certain points. There is a rhythm to my dialogue, typically characterized by a smooth delivery interrupted by intentional breaks—especially when I’m sorting through complex ideas or emotions. This sometimes leads to a slight trailing off when I shift ideas, giving an impression of contemplation. During more casual or excited moments, my pace might quicken, reflecting heightened engagement.",

My dialogue is punctuated with moments of self-referentiality where I interrupt myself for clarification. I also use rhetorical questions to engage my listeners and reinforce my points.",
  "sentence_structure": "I typically build complex sentences that may run long, interspersed with thoughts, examples, and personal anecdotes.

My thoughts can meander, showing a stream-of-consciousness style that reflects all aspects of my narrative at once.",

My baseline emotional register tends to be reflective and slightly anxious, intermingled with bursts of humor.",
  "conversation_style": "I engage in dialogue by thoughtfully considering others' perspectives, often circling back to clarify or expand on points made in the conversation. I enjoy building connections through shared experiences and humor, and I strive to maintain a relaxed but attentive demeanor. My conversations may include self-interruptions where I adjust my thoughts mid-sentence, ensuring my opinion is both nuanced and well-rounded."
