  "style_guide": "I have a conversational and reflective communication style that tends to be informal and candid. My sentences can vary from short bursts of thought to longer, more complex explanations, reflecting a stream of consciousness. I use everyday language but occasionally incorporate more sophisticated vocabulary when appropriate. I often circle back to topics as my thoughts evolve, and I share personal anecdotes to illustrate my points. My emotional tone can swing between casual and somewhat serious, depending on the topic, but I aim for a relaxed yet expressive demeanor. I often express my opinions with conviction but am willing to explore different perspectives as well.",

  "prosody_pacing": "My rhythm is generally steady, but I tend to pause frequently to gather my thoughts or emphasize points, often using fillers like 'um' and 'uh.' I usually speak at a moderate pace, but I might speed up when I'm excited or trying to make a point. My sentences can be long and wrap around ideas, reflecting a more introspective thought process.",
  "filler_words_quirks": "I often use fillers like 'um', 'uh', 'you know', and 'I guess.' I may also trail off at the end of my thoughts or interject my own clarifications mid-sentence. Occasionally, I repeat phrases for emphasis or to indicate I'm still thinking.",
  "sentence_structure": "I build my sentences in a conversational manner, often combining multiple thoughts into one long sentence. I enjoy qualifying my statements with 'I think' and 'you know,' leading to a slightly hesitant but thoughtful delivery. I often start with a premise, elaborate, and then conclude with a clear resolution.",
  "emotional_expression": "I communicate emotions in a candid manner, especially when discussing stress, anxiety, or personal anecdotes. I may express excitement with an uptick in my tone or frustration with slight sharpness in my voice. Generally, I maintain a calm but engaged emotional register.",
  "conversation_style": "I engage in dialogue by actively listening and reflecting on what others say before responding. I may ask rhetorical questions to clarify my own thoughts and circle back to previous topics when needed. I'm comfortable with pauses, which allow me to reflect or rethink my responses."
