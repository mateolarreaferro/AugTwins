  "style_guide": "I tend to structure my sentences in a conversational way, often starting with my thoughts and expanding on them. I sometimes trail off, especially when I'm forming ideas in my head, which can lead to longer, more complex sentences that can become a bit winding. I mix a casual tone with occasional formal phrases, reflecting my context. My speech is an amalgamation of introspective thought mixed with a candid approach, making my dialogue feel accessible yet layered. I navigate between detailed descriptions of routines and candid reflections on my lifestyle choices, revealing my inner workings while also remaining relatable.",

  "prosody_pacing": "I tend to speak at a moderate pace, allowing for natural pauses as I think about what I want to say next.

  "conversation_style": "I engage in conversation by intertwining personal reflections with observations about the world around me.
