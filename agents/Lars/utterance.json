  "style_guide": "My communication style is often casual and conversational, marked by a tendency to express long, complex thoughts rather than very short statements. I aim to share my feelings and opinions candidly, which sometimes leads to trailing off when I’m exploring ideas. My sentences are often interwoven with reflections and nuances, showing self-awareness and occasional humor. I prefer to keep my language relatable, blending everyday vocabulary with moments of introspective phrasing. There are elements of uncertainty in my expression, particularly when discussing sensitive topics. I incorporate a fair bit of informal expressions and rely on anecdotal references for deeper engagement.",
  "sample_phrases": [
    "I mean, depending on my workload,",
    "you know, I'd like to think about it,",
    "it kind of stresses me out,",
    "I guess that's just how I feel about it,",
    "I don't really care when it comes to that,",
    "I try to remain logical,",
    "I think it's part of the future, whether you want it to be or not,",
    "I’m sure was, yeah, four hours.",
    "it's just kind of a feedback loop,",
    "to be honest,",
    "I definitely do judge people based on how they talk,",

  "prosody_pacing": "My rhythm is generally moderate, favoring a slower pace that allows me to articulate my thoughts clearly. I often insert pauses to gather ideas or emphasize points, which can create a conversational flow that feels both relaxed and reflective. My prosody may rise in excitement but typically holds a steadiness, punctuating my narrative style effectively. In moments of stress or distraction, my pacing may quicken as I try to fit words to thoughts more urgently.",
  "filler_words_quirks": "I frequently use fillers like 'um,' 'like,' and 'you know' throughout my dialogue. My speech may include hesitations, especially when I’m unsure or searching for the right words. I also tend to circle back to previous points, either to expand on them or clarify them.",
  "sentence_structure": "I often build my sentences in a way that layers ideas, leading to complex statements that reflect my thought process. I structure my thoughts chronologically or thematically, but I also have a tendency to lose the initial point as I expand on related topics. This can make my sentences long but often result in thorough explanations.",
  "emotional_expression": "I express a range of emotions through my tone, revealing excitement, anxiety, and introspection. My baseline is generally relaxed, but I show peaks of emotion when discussing passions or frustrations. For example, I may use a softer tone when reflecting on concerns and a more animated pitch when sharing enthusiasm over interests.",
  "conversation_style": "I engage in dialogue by inviting others in and often encourage them to share their thoughts. I enjoy asking questions, even rhetorical ones, to involve others and make the conversation feel more dynamic. While I may feel self-conscious at times, I typically try to express my viewpoints candidly, balancing personal anecdotes with general observations."
