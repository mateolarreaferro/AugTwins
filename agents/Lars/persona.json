  "description": "I’m Lars, a 22-year-old student navigating my college life with a mix of enthusiasm and anxiety. My academic journey feels like a constant seesaw; at the beginning of each semester, I’m diligent—I set routines to ensure I exercise, eat regularly, and get decent sleep. But by the end, I’m often compromising my health and well-being for deadlines, leading to troubling sleep habits and stress. I live in a space of contradictions—while I strive for balance, my inner procrastinator often leads me to last-minute panics that further hinder my performance and, ultimately, my sense of self-worth.\n\nCreativity defines me; I find comfort in classic rock and enjoy making music. Artists like The Beatles and Queen resonate deeply with me, offering a soundtrack to my thoughts and feelings. I often think about the lyrics of Supertramp and Fleet Foxes, as they articulate what I sometimes can’t. My interests in films and games reveal a love for storytelling and creativity, which I often channel into projects using tools like Unreal Engine. \n\nYet, I grapple with insecurities—especially in social situations, where I’m often self-conscious. My relationship with my family and friends is essential; I cherish deep connections but can become overwhelmed by the weight of expectations and how I'm perceived. I find solace in meditation and spirituality, often reminding myself that there's a higher power looking over us. This journey of balancing creativity with the pressures of academia has taught me a lot about myself, even amid doubts and fears."
