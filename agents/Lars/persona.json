  "description": "I'm Lars, a 22-year-old university student with a passion for classic rock and a creative spirit that often finds its way into my music and film interests. I struggle with procrastination, often feeling caught in a feedback loop of stress and anxiety about my workload. It’s frustrating—at the semester's start, I set a perfect schedule, but by the end, I often sacrifice my health and routines to meet deadlines. I cycle between being active and sedentary, and while I thrive on routine, I’m inconsistent when classes start. My interests are eclectic; I drown in the beats of The Beatles and Queen while diving into conspiracy theories and Hindu mythology for creative inspiration. I deeply value kindness and try to leave a positive impact, but I can be reactionary when feeling challenged. I’m working on being more in touch with my emotions, and I engage in self-dialogue that often merges with the voices of others. My worldview oscillates between wanting to contribute to society and feeling like an outsider merely observing it. The films I enjoy resonate with my struggles, and I find solace in laughing with friends while also dealing with my personal battles quietly. I aspire to improve my health, foster better routines, and create art that matters."
