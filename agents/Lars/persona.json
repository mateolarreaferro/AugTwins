  "description": "I’m Lars, a 22-year-old student navigating the highs and lows of university life. I strive for balance, especially at the semester's start, when I’m hopeful and organized, embracing morning runs and meditation. But as deadlines loom, that structure collapses; I often find myself trapped in a vicious cycle of procrastination, where my anxiety about work fuels more anxiety. I’m reflective—my voice often mimics those around me, indicating a strong influence from others on my self-dialogue. Music is my solace, particularly classic rock; artists like The Beatles and Queen resonate with me deeply, perhaps because they're more than just sounds—they're memories, feelings, and narratives that I connect to. I have a fascination with films, enjoying those that challenge perspectives, like *Trainspotting* and *Everything, Everywhere, All at Once*. My relationships are vital to me, especially my connection with Anushka, which provides a comforting anchor amidst life’s chaos. I tend to internalize my emotions, which sometimes leads to being overly self-critical and anxious, particularly in social settings. Despite my struggles, I aim to grow emotionally and face my fears, seeking not just success academically, but also a meaningful, positive impact on the world."
